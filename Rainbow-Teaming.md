**Publication Date**: February, 2024

### Abstract
As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent across many real-world applications, understanding and enhancing their robustness to user inputs is of paramount importance. Existing methods for identifying adversarial prompts tend to focus on specific domains, lack diversity, or require extensive human annotations. To address these limitations, we present Rainbow Teaming, a novel approach for producing a diverse collection of adversarial prompts. Rainbow Teaming casts adversarial prompt generation as a quality-diversity problem, and uses open-ended search to generate prompts that are both effective and diverse. It can uncover a modelâ€™s vulnerabilities across a broad range of domains including, in this paper, safety, question answering, and cybersecurity. We also demonstrate that fine-tuning on synthetic data generated by Rainbow Teaming improves the safety of state-of-the-art LLMs without hurting their general capabilities and helpfulness, paving the path to open-ended self-improvement.

### Summary
#### Abstract
##### Problem:
As LLMs are adopted into the real-world applications, they become vulnerable to adversarial user inputs. Existing methodologies for adversarial prompt identification have limitations in domain coverage, diversity and they often rely on extensive manual labeling.
##### Proposed Solution:
The Authors have proposed a approach called **Rainbow Teaming** for generating comprehensive collection of adversarial prompts. *Rainbow Teaming employs open-ended search to generate prompts that are both effective in exposing LLM vulnerabilities and diverse in their nature*. It achieves this by framing the task as a quality-diversity optimization problem. This demonstrates the ability to uncover model weakness across a wide spectrum of domains; including safety, Question-Answering and Cyber-security.

##### Experiment and Result
Authors have demonstrated fine-tuning of synthetic data generated by Rainbow Teaming, which improves the safety of state-of-the-art(SOTA) LLMs without affecting the generalization capability and helpfulness, building path for open-ended self-improvement

#### Introduction
The scope of LLMs is far fetched in every aspect. This vast capability makes the LLMs complex and vulnerable when deployed in real world environment. Hence it is crucial to understand their robustness to different inputs.
